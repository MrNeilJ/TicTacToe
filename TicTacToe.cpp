/*
 Write a class called TicTacToe that allows two people to play a game.  This class will have a field for a
 Board object and a field to keep track of which player's turn it is.  It should have a constructor that
 takes a char parameter that specifies whether 'x' or 'o' should have the first move.  It should have a
 method called play that starts the game.  The play method should keep looping, asking the correct player
 for their move and sending it to the board (with makeMove) until someone has won or it's a draw (as
 indicated by gameState), and then declare what the outcome was.
